# End-to-End Data Science Project

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning pipeline built in Python using VS Code. The goal is to demonstrate a complete data science workflow from raw data to final model evaluation and deployment.

## 📁 Project Structure

📂 data/ - Raw, processed, and final datasets
📂 src/ - Source code: data loading, feature engineering, modeling, etc.
📂 outputs/ - Model results, visualizations, and artifacts
📂 reports/ - EDA reports and analysis figures
📄 main.py - Entry point for the entire pipeline
📄 requirements.txt - Required Python packages


## 🚀 Workflow Steps

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model Building & Training  
5. Evaluation  
6. Deployment (optional)

## 🛠 How to Run

Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```


📦 Requirements
Python 3.10+

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
